The European Commission just published the most sweeping reform of EU digital laws since 2018 - and everything you thought you knew about data protection compliance might be about to change.</p><h2 id=the-regulatory-earthquake-you-cant-ignore>The Regulatory Earthquake You Can&rsquo;t Ignore</h2><p>On 19 November 2025, the European Commission released two proposed regulations that will fundamentally reshape how businesses handle data, AI, and cybersecurity in Europe. The Digital Omnibus (2025/0360) and Digital Omnibus on AI (2025/0359) aren&rsquo;t minor tweaks - they&rsquo;re a complete rethinking of the EU&rsquo;s approach to digital regulation.</p><p>The Commission&rsquo;s goal? Cut administrative burden by 25% for all companies and 35% for SMEs. But here&rsquo;s what matters to you: these changes will force you to rethink processes you&rsquo;ve spent years building.</p><h2 id=gdpr-changes-that-will-transform-your-data-operations>GDPR Changes That Will Transform Your Data Operations</h2><p><strong>The Definition of Personal Data Is Changing</strong></p><p>Here&rsquo;s the change that should make every DPO sit up: the very definition of personal data is being rewritten.</p><p>Under the proposed rules, if <em>your organization</em> doesn&rsquo;t have reasonable means to identify an individual, that data isn&rsquo;t personal data <em>for you</em> - even if someone else could identify that person. This subjective approach, aligned with the recent CJEU ruling in EDPS v SRB, could mean entire datasets you&rsquo;re currently treating as personal data might no longer require GDPR treatment.</p><p>Are you ready to reassess every dataset in your organization?</p><p><strong>AI Training on Personal Data Gets a Green Light</strong></p><p>Still struggling to find a legal basis for using personal data to train your AI models? The Commission just handed you one: a new provision explicitly confirms that AI model training constitutes a legitimate interest under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p><p>But don&rsquo;t celebrate too quickly - you still need to pass the balancing test. And here&rsquo;s the catch that&rsquo;s already causing concern: Member States can still require consent for AI training under national law. The fragmentation risk is real.</p><p><strong>Your Privacy Notices Might Be Overkill</strong></p><p>Are you sending elaborate privacy notices to people who already know exactly who you are and why you&rsquo;re processing their data? Under the new rules, you might not need to. If there are reasonable grounds to assume the individual already knows, no notice is required.</p><p>The exception won&rsquo;t apply for third-party transfers, automated decision-making, or high-risk processing - but for straightforward B2B relationships and simple consumer interactions, this could eliminate significant compliance overhead.</p><p><strong>DSARs Used as Weapons? You Can Fight Back</strong></p><p>Every compliance officer knows the problem: data subject access requests weaponized in employment disputes or used as leverage. The Omnibus explicitly allows you to refuse requests or charge fees when individuals abuse their rights - including when they deliberately provoke refusal to claim compensation, or offer to withdraw requests in exchange for benefits.</p><p>This is the clarity HR departments have been waiting for.</p><p><strong>Breach Reporting Gets Simpler - and Slower</strong></p><p>The 72-hour scramble after a data breach? It&rsquo;s becoming 96 hours. And you&rsquo;ll only need to report breaches posing &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; to individuals - aligning with the notification threshold for data subjects.</p><p>Better still: a single reporting portal is coming for all your incident notifications across GDPR, NIS2, DORA, and more. Report once, reach all relevant authorities.</p><h2 id=the-cookie-banner-revolution-youve-been-waiting-for>The Cookie Banner Revolution You&rsquo;ve Been Waiting For</h2><p><strong>One-Click Rejection Becomes Mandatory</strong></p><p>Cookie consent fatigue is officially recognized as a problem. The solution? Controllers must provide single-click rejection. No more dark patterns. No more 47 clicks to refuse tracking. Websites must respect your choice for at least six months.</p><p><strong>Automated Consent Signals Are Coming</strong></p><p>This is the big one: within 24 months of adoption, you&rsquo;ll need to enable users to give or refuse consent through automated, machine-readable mechanisms - think Global Privacy Control, but mandatory. Browser providers have 48 months to build in the tools.</p><p>The era of cookie banners may finally be ending. But are you ready for the technical implementation this requires?</p><p><strong>New Exceptions That Actually Matter</strong></p><p>Two new scenarios where you won&rsquo;t need consent:</p><ul><li><p>Aggregated audience measurement for your own analytics</p></li><li><p>Security-related storage (like automatic updates)</p></li></ul><p>For the adtech industry, this provides some breathing room - but don&rsquo;t mistake simplification for permission. The regulatory scrutiny of data-intensive advertising isn&rsquo;t going away.</p><h2 id=ai-act-the-breathing-room-you-needed>AI Act: The Breathing Room You Needed</h2><p><strong>High-Risk Deadlines Are Sliding</strong></p><p>If you&rsquo;re racing to comply with high-risk AI system requirements by August 2026, you might be able to slow down. The proposal delays obligations by 6-12 months after technical standards are approved - with hard stops at December 2027 and August 2028 depending on the system category.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t the Commission going soft on AI regulation. It&rsquo;s an acknowledgment that you can&rsquo;t comply with requirements when the standards don&rsquo;t exist yet.</p><p><strong>AI Literacy Becomes Optional</strong></p><p>Were you struggling to implement AI literacy programs across your organization? The mandatory obligation is becoming an &ldquo;encouragement.&rdquo; The Commission and Member States will foster literacy - but you won&rsquo;t be directly obligated.</p><p><strong>SME Privileges Expand</strong></p><p>If you&rsquo;re a small mid-cap company, you&rsquo;re now eligible for the same regulatory privileges as SMEs: lower fines and simplified documentation requirements. Check if you qualify.</p><p><strong>Registration Requirements Narrowed</strong></p><p>Concluded that your AI system doesn&rsquo;t pose significant risk to health, safety, or fundamental rights? Under the new rules, you won&rsquo;t need to register it in the EU database. Less bureaucracy for lower-risk applications.</p><h2 id=cybersecurity-one-portal-to-rule-them-all>Cybersecurity: One Portal to Rule Them All</h2><p><strong>The Single Entry Point Is Coming</strong></p><p>ENISA is building a centralized platform for all your incident reporting obligations. NIS2, GDPR breaches, DORA incidents - everything goes through one interface, gets automatically routed to relevant authorities.</p><p>No more filing the same incident report five different ways to five different regulators.</p><p>The timeline: 18 months after adoption for piloting, then a Commission confirmation before full operation. Start planning your internal processes now.</p><h2 id=data-act-winners-and-losers>Data Act: Winners and Losers</h2><p><strong>Cloud Switching Gets Easier (For Some)</strong></p><p>Running custom-made data processing services? The switching obligations are being relaxed. SMEs and SMCs with contracts from before September 2025 get additional flexibility. You can include proportionate early termination penalties.</p><p>SaaS providers have been lobbying hard for this - and they got it.</p><p><strong>Trade Secret Protection Strengthens</strong></p><p>Here&rsquo;s a win for businesses worried about forced data disclosure: you can now refuse to share trade secrets if disclosure would cause serious economic damage or if there&rsquo;s high risk of the information reaching third countries with weaker protections.</p><p>Document your reasoning carefully - refusals must be justified in writing.</p><p><strong>Public Sector Data Demands Restricted</strong></p><p>Government authorities demanding your data? The threshold just got higher: from &ldquo;exceptional need&rdquo; to &ldquo;public emergencies&rdquo; only. And if you&rsquo;re a micro or small enterprise, you can claim compensation.</p><h2 id=the-privacy-activists-are-not-happy>The Privacy Activists Are Not Happy</h2><p>Before you celebrate the reduced compliance burden, understand the opposition. On 11 November, noyb, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, and European Digital Rights published a joint open letter expressing serious concerns:</p><ul><li><p>Potential erosion of individual privacy protections</p></li><li><p>Easier paths for AI companies to use personal data without adequate safeguards</p></li><li><p>Risk of regulatory fragmentation as Member States add their own requirements</p></li></ul><p>These organizations have successfully challenged major tech companies before. Don&rsquo;t assume the proposals will pass unchanged.</p><h2 id=what-happens-next>What Happens Next</h2><p><strong>The Legislative Timeline</strong></p><ul><li><p>December 2025 - January 2026: Assignment to Parliament committees (IMCO, ITRE, LIBE)</p></li><li><p>Q1 2026: Committee discussions, amendments, Council positioning</p></li><li><p>Q2/Q3 2026: Trilogue negotiations</p></li><li><p>Mid-late 2026: Expected adoption</p></li></ul><p><strong>The Fast-Track Possibility</strong></p><p>Parliament could invoke Rule 170 for urgent procedure, potentially enabling adoption as early as Q1 2026. If that happens, your preparation window just got much shorter.</p><h2 id=the-strategic-question-you-must-answer-now>The Strategic Question You Must Answer Now</h2><p>These proposals will change. Trilogue negotiations always produce compromises. But the direction is clear: simplification, consolidation, and competitiveness.</p><p>The question isn&rsquo;t whether to prepare - it&rsquo;s how aggressively. Organizations that wait for final adoption will scramble to catch up. Those that start scenario planning now will turn regulatory change into competitive advantage.</p><p>So ask yourself: Is your current compliance strategy built for flexibility, or will you be rebuilding from scratch when these rules take effect?</p><p>The Commission has made its move. What&rsquo;s yours?</p><hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"><p><em>This article provides general information and does not constitute legal advice.
