&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve seen the headlines. You&amp;rsquo;ve attended the boardroom presentations. Some consultant with expensive slides told you AI will &amp;ldquo;transform your workforce&amp;rdquo; and you nodded along while mentally calculating severance packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start drafting those redundancy letters, let&amp;rsquo;s talk numbers. Not the shiny projected ones. The real ones.&lt;/p&gt;

Soon we&amp;rsquo;ll be generating things through neural interfaces paired with AI agents. (Screenshot this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now everyone can make anything - and everyone does. Content factories pump out AI-generated slop at industrial scale. Algorithms lock us into bubbles of perfectly curated comfort: soft, familiar, frictionless. Reels, shorts, endless scroll. Attention has become reflexive.

&lt;h2 id="the-regulatory-earthquake-you-cant-ignore"&gt;The Regulatory Earthquake You Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 19 November 2025, the European Commission released two proposed regulations that will fundamentally reshape how businesses handle data, AI, and cybersecurity in Europe. The Digital Omnibus (2025/0360) and Digital Omnibus on AI (2025/0359) aren&amp;rsquo;t minor tweaks - they&amp;rsquo;re a complete rethinking of the EU&amp;rsquo;s approach to digital regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>UK Judge Uses AI to Draft Legal Decision: Are You Ready for AI in Professional Decision-Making?</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/10/08/uk-judge-uses-ai-to-draft-legal-decision-are-you-ready-for-ai-in-professional-decision-making/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:06:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/10/08/uk-judge-uses-ai-to-draft-legal-decision-are-you-ready-for-ai-in-professional-decision-making/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered what happens when &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-intelligence"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; enters the courtroom? A UK &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/courts-and-tribunals/tribunals/first-tier-tribunal/"&gt;First-Tier Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; judge recently provided a notable answer, becoming one of the first to openly disclose using AI in drafting a judicial decision - and the implications extend far beyond the legal profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 17, 2025, the Italian Parliament approved &lt;a href="https://www.mwe.com/insights/italy-becomes-the-first-in-europe-to-set-national-ai-rules/"&gt;Law No. 132 of 23 September 2025&lt;/a&gt;, officially taking effect on October 10, 2025. This groundbreaking legislation doesn&amp;rsquo;t just complement the &lt;a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/high-level-summary/"&gt;EU AI Act&lt;/a&gt; – the European Union&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive framework that &lt;a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence"&gt;classifies AI systems by risk levels&lt;/a&gt; – it fills critical gaps and establishes precedents that other European nations are likely to follow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Are Your AI Agents Legally Compliant?

&lt;h2 id="the-scale-of-exposure"&gt;The Scale of Exposure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco&amp;rsquo;s research team discovered numerous Ollama servers - a popular platform for running LLMs locally - exposed to the internet without proper security controls. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that &lt;strong&gt;Ollama is designed with secure defaults&lt;/strong&gt;. By default, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/11941"&gt;Ollama binds only to localhost (127.0.0.1)&lt;/a&gt;, restricting access to the local machine only. The exposures identified by Cisco&amp;rsquo;s research occur when administrators deliberately override these secure defaults by setting the &lt;code&gt;OLLAMA_HOST&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; to enable remote access, but fail to implement proper security measures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Are You Ready for Your Robot Teammate?

A &lt;strong&gt;landmark lawsuit&lt;/strong&gt; between &lt;a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/blog/2024/04/nyt-v-openai-the-timess-about-face/"&gt;The New York Times (NYT) and OpenAI&lt;/a&gt; reveals a troubling reality: “deleted” data might still be stored, analyzed, or exposed in ways you never intended or consented to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="your-deleted-data-isnt-always-deleted"&gt;Your Deleted Data Isn&amp;rsquo;t Always Deleted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681280/openai-storing-deleted-chats-nyt-lawsuit"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;, OpenAI has stored deleted conversations, despite users’ expectation of privacy. This practice is currently being challenged in court and has sparked debate around what “delete” really means in the context of &lt;strong&gt;AI chatbots&lt;/strong&gt; and cloud-based interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Are Your IT Audits Ready for the AI Revolution?

A recent &lt;a href="https://www.isaca.org/resources/news-and-trends/isaca-now-blog/2025/five-ways-that-it-auditors-can-put-ai-to-good-use"&gt;ISACA analysis&lt;/a&gt; reveals five transformative applications of AI in IT auditing that could revolutionize how you approach risk assessment and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-ai-audit-advantage-beyond-human-limitations"&gt;The AI Audit Advantage: Beyond Human Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional auditing methods, while thorough, face inherent constraints: time limitations, human error, and the sheer volume of data in modern organizations. AI transforms these challenges into opportunities through &lt;strong&gt;risk analysis automation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;intelligent evidence collection&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;continuous controls testing&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;real-time assurance monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive process automation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Is Your Enterprise Database Strategy Ready for the Foundation Model Revolution?</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/05/is-your-enterprise-database-strategy-ready-for-the-foundation-model-revolution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:13:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/05/is-your-enterprise-database-strategy-ready-for-the-foundation-model-revolution/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you still moving data to AI algorithms instead of bringing AI to your data? &lt;a href="https://kumo.ai/company/news/kumo-relational-foundation-model/"&gt;Kumo AI&amp;rsquo;s KumoRFM&lt;/a&gt; shows a fundamental shift that could reshape how enterprises handle their most valuable asset: structured data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-game-changing-approach"&gt;The Game-Changing Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KumoRFM represents the first Relational Foundation Model (RFM) designed specifically for structured and relational data. Unlike traditional AI models that require extensive task-specific training and costly data migration, KumoRFM leverages &lt;strong&gt;in-context learning&lt;/strong&gt; to deliver accurate predictions across diverse databases without retraining.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Is Your Team Ready for AI? Why Education Must Come Before Implementation</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/02/is-your-team-ready-for-ai-why-education-must-come-before-implementation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 08:35:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/02/is-your-team-ready-for-ai-why-education-must-come-before-implementation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Picture this: your organization just invested in cutting-edge AI technology, but your team doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand how it works, when it might fail, or what legal obligations come with its use. Sound familiar? You&amp;rsquo;re not alone—and you&amp;rsquo;re potentially in violation of the &lt;a href="https://www.lexia.it/en/2025/05/30/ai-literacy-and-faqs/"&gt;European AI Act&lt;/a&gt;, which mandates AI literacy training as of February 2, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-knowledge-first-imperative"&gt;The Knowledge-First Imperative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle is simple yet revolutionary: &lt;strong&gt;knowledge is power, and it&amp;rsquo;s crucial for successful AI integration to have educated personnel first, not after integration&lt;/strong&gt;. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just good practice—it&amp;rsquo;s now a legal requirement under EU regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
