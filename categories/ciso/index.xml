Security researcher &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/"&gt;Simon Willison&amp;rsquo;s recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; reveals a chilling reality: AI agents combining three specific capabilities create what he calls the &amp;ldquo;lethal trifecta&amp;rdquo; – a combination so dangerous that attackers can easily trick systems into accessing private data and sending it directly to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-three-components-that-spell-disaster"&gt;The Three Components That Spell Disaster&lt;/h2&gt;

If so, your organization might be missing critical vulnerabilities that could compromise both your operations and compliance posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-dangerous-misconception"&gt;The Dangerous Misconception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many languages use the same word for both concepts, &lt;a href="https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/when-it-comes-to-ai-incidents-safety-and-security-are-not-the-same"&gt;the OECD emphasizes that AI safety and security are distinct yet interconnected domains&lt;/a&gt; that require different approaches and frameworks.

&lt;p&gt;As someone working daily with ISO standards and AI governance frameworks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been closely following NIST&amp;rsquo;s post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process. What I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered should concern every InfoSec professional: the threat to our current encryption isn&amp;rsquo;t waiting for some hypothetical quantum computer. It&amp;rsquo;s already growing in GPU farms around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll break down what you need to know about post-quantum cryptography without the complex mathematics. More importantly, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why this matters for your organization today, not in some distant quantum future.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Your AI Guardrails Just Got Outsmarted by Emojis: The Semantic Prompt Injection Crisis</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/08/03/your-ai-guardrails-just-got-outsmarted-by-emojis-the-semantic-prompt-injection-crisis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 09:17:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/08/03/your-ai-guardrails-just-got-outsmarted-by-emojis-the-semantic-prompt-injection-crisis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are your AI systems as secure as you think?

&lt;h2 id="the-invisible-threat-in-plain-sight"&gt;The Invisible Threat in Plain Sight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-a-prompt-injection-attack"&gt;Semantic prompt injections&lt;/a&gt; represent an emerging frontier in adversarial attacks against AI systems. Unlike traditional &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-injection"&gt;prompt injections&lt;/a&gt; that rely on text manipulation, these attacks use symbolic visual inputs - emoji-like sequences, rebus puzzles, and other visual representations - to potentially compromise &lt;a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/securing-agentic-ai-how-semantic-prompt-injections-bypass-ai-guardrails/"&gt;agentic AI systems&lt;/a&gt; while evading some detection methods.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Amazon's AI Assistant Nearly Wiped Developer Systems for 5 Days – Are Your Access Controls Ready?</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/07/29/amazons-ai-assistant-nearly-wiped-developer-systems-for-5-days-are-your-access-controls-ready/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 19:14:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/07/29/amazons-ai-assistant-nearly-wiped-developer-systems-for-5-days-are-your-access-controls-ready/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Picture this scenario:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re working late, relying on your trusted &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-assisted_programming"&gt;AI coding assistant&lt;/a&gt; to help debug a critical application.

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a hypothetical nightmare. It actually happened to &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/"&gt;Amazon Q Developer Extension&lt;/a&gt; users for five consecutive days, and the implications should make every &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_security_officer"&gt;Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)&lt;/a&gt; reassess their AI integration strategies immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Your AI Procurement Strategy Could Be Your Biggest Compliance Risk: What Financial Services Must Know</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/07/01/your-ai-procurement-strategy-could-be-your-biggest-compliance-risk-what-financial-services-must-know/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/07/01/your-ai-procurement-strategy-could-be-your-biggest-compliance-risk-what-financial-services-must-know/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you rushing to procure AI solutions for your financial services firm without considering the legal minefield you&amp;rsquo;re entering? While competitors scramble to deploy the latest AI tools, smart institutions are discovering that &lt;strong&gt;procurement strategy - not just implementation - determines compliance success&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-procurement-blind-spot-thats-costing-millions"&gt;The Procurement Blind Spot That&amp;rsquo;s Costing Millions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most financial institutions approach AI procurement like any other technology purchase. This is a critical mistake. Unlike traditional software, AI systems in financial services must navigate an intricate web of regulations including the &lt;a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/a&gt; - the EU&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive data privacy law that governs how personal information must be handled - &lt;a href="https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en"&gt;Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)&lt;/a&gt; - a new EU regulation requiring financial institutions to strengthen their digital resilience against cyber threats - and emerging &lt;a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/"&gt;AI-specific legislation&lt;/a&gt; like the EU AI Act.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>MCP's Hidden Security Crisis: Why Your AI Automation Strategy Needs an Urgent Reality Check</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/24/mcps-hidden-security-crisis-why-your-ai-automation-strategy-needs-an-urgent-reality-check/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 16:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/24/mcps-hidden-security-crisis-why-your-ai-automation-strategy-needs-an-urgent-reality-check/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you rushing to implement &lt;a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol"&gt;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&lt;/a&gt; for your AI automation workflows?

While your competitors scramble to understand the &lt;a href="https://www.artificial-intelligence-act.com/"&gt;EU AI Act&lt;/a&gt;, smart institutions are taking a &amp;ldquo;DORA first&amp;rdquo; approach - and it might be the difference between thriving and merely surviving the 2027 compliance deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-perfect-storm-when-dora-meets-ai-act"&gt;The Perfect Storm: When DORA Meets AI Act&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.mofo.com/resources/insights/250218-european-digital-compliance-key-digital-regulation-compliance"&gt;Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)&lt;/a&gt;, which became applicable on &lt;strong&gt;January 17, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, has already transformed how financial institutions manage &lt;a href="https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/trm/ict-risk-management-under-dora"&gt;ICT risk&lt;/a&gt; (Information and Communication Technology risks that could compromise network and information systems).

A landmark ruling by Germany&amp;rsquo;s Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht) should make you pause and reconsider your approach. The court awarded €200 in damages to an employee whose personal data was improperly transferred during cloud-based HR software testing - and this decision could reshape how companies handle employee data across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-case-that-changes-everything"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Case That Changes Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involved an employee whose personal data was transferred to &lt;a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/news/germany-federal-labor-court-allows-non-material"&gt;Workday&lt;/a&gt; HR management software beyond the agreed limits of a concluded works agreement (a formal contract between employer and employee that defines terms and conditions of employment).
