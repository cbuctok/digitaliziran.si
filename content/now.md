## Building an AI Governance Practice in Slovenia

I'm co-founding an AI consulting and auditing startup for SMEs. We help companies that are too big to ignore AI, too small for expensive international consultants.

## What I Actually Do

**Consulting & Implementation:** ISO 42001 AI Management Systems, ISO 27001 Information Security. I help organizations build governance frameworks that actually work.

**Auditing:** Certified ISO 27001 auditor, ISM and AIM. Independence matters - I keep consulting and auditing roles strictly separate.

**Teaching:** Automation workshops, AI governance training, cybersecurity fundamentals. Learning as much as I'm teaching.

## Outside Work

**Reading:** Niche blogs, revisiting classics, and whatever rabbit hole hasn't been optimized for engagement yet.

**Traveling:** Sailing when I can. Mostly slow travel by car - returning to the same places, settling in rather than passing through. I try to spend time each year in another town. A morning market. A local farm. A coworking space if I need one. A bench somewhere. Mostly just being there.

## Based in

Ljubljana, Slovenia
