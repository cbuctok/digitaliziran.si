Are you treating [AI safety](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-safety) and [AI security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-ai-for-cybersecurity) as the same thing? If so, your organization might be missing critical vulnerabilities that could compromise both your operations and compliance posture.

## The Dangerous Misconception

While many languages use the same word for both concepts, [the OECD emphasizes that AI safety and security are distinct yet interconnected domains](https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/when-it-comes-to-ai-incidents-safety-and-security-are-not-the-same) that require different approaches and frameworks. This distinction isn't just academic - it has real implications for how you protect your organization.

**[AI Safety](https://www.tigera.io/learn/guides/llm-security/ai-safety/)** focuses on preventing unintentional harm and ensuring reliable operation. Think of it as protecting against system failures, [biased outputs](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence), or unexpected behaviors that could damage your business reputation or violate regulations.

**[AI Security](https://www.wiz.io/academy/ai-security)**, on the other hand, aims to protect AI systems from malicious threats and deliberate attacks. This includes defending against [prompt injections](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-generative-ai-security), [model poisoning](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/ai-security-posture-management-ai-spm/), and [adversarial attacks](https://www.wallarm.com/what/ai-security-risks-frameworks-and-best-practices) designed to compromise your systems.

## Why This Matters for Your Risk Management

The confusion between these domains creates dangerous blind spots in organizational [risk assessments](https://www.protex.ai/guides/the-complete-guide-to-ai-safety-in-the-workplace). When you conflate safety and security, you might:

- **Underestimate threat vectors**: Security-focused measures won't catch safety issues like [algorithmic bias](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-101-the-basics-of-ai) or [model drift](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence)

- **Misallocate resources**: Investing heavily in [cybersecurity](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity) while neglecting safety controls (or vice versa)

- **Create compliance gaps**: Different regulations may require distinct safety versus security measures

[Recent research highlights](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18932v1) that integrating security-specific data into broader safety frameworks can enhance AI resilience - but only when organizations understand the unique challenges each domain presents.

## The Integration Opportunity

Here's the strategic insight: while safety and security are different, they're not mutually exclusive. The most resilient AI systems integrate both approaches:

- **Unified incident reporting** that captures both safety failures and security breaches

- **Cross-domain risk assessments** that consider how safety issues might create security vulnerabilities

- **Integrated response strategies** that address both unintentional harm and malicious attacks

## Questions You Should Be Asking

As you evaluate your [AI governance framework](https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ultimate-guide-ai-safety-ethics), consider:

- Does your risk assessment distinguish between safety and security threats?

- Are your incident response procedures equipped to handle both domains?

- Do your compliance frameworks adequately address AI-specific safety and security requirements?

- How would a safety failure in your AI system create new security vulnerabilities?

## Moving Forward Strategically

The organizations that will thrive in the AI era are those that recognize this critical distinction while building integrated approaches. This means developing frameworks that address both domains without compromising either.

As the OECD research suggests, understanding these differences allows organizations to better address the unique challenges each area presents, ultimately fostering a safer and more secure AI ecosystem.

The question isn't whether your organization will face AI-related challenges - it's whether you'll be prepared with the right frameworks to address both safety and security concerns when they arise.
