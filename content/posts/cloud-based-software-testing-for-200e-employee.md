Are you testing new HR software in your organization? A landmark ruling by Germany's Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht) should make you pause and reconsider your approach. The court awarded €200 in damages to an employee whose personal data was improperly transferred during cloud-based HR software testing - and this decision could reshape how companies handle employee data across Europe.

## **The Case That Changes Everything**

The case involved an employee whose personal data was transferred to [Workday](https://www.dataguidance.com/news/germany-federal-labor-court-allows-non-material) HR management software beyond the agreed limits of a concluded works agreement (a formal contract between employer and employee that defines terms and conditions of employment). What makes this ruling particularly significant is that the court confirmed that even limited misuse of employee data can trigger liability under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

According to [legal experts analyzing the decision](https://www.orrick.com/en/Insights/2025/05/German-Federal-Labor-Court-Grants-Damages-Under-the-GDPR-for-the-Use-of-Employee-Data), the Federal Labour Court emphasized that works agreements must comply with all GDPR requirements, including Articles 5, 6, and 9, and are subject to full judicial review. This means your internal agreements don't shield you from GDPR violations - they must actually prevent them.

## **Why Your Testing Phase Is Your Biggest Risk**

Here's what many organizations don't realize: the testing phase of HR software implementation often involves the most dangerous data handling practices. During testing, companies frequently:

- Transfer real employee data to cloud environments without proper safeguards

- Exceed the scope of existing works agreements or employee consent

- Assume internal agreements provide sufficient legal protection

- Fail to implement adequate technical and organizational measures

The German court's decision makes clear that [unauthorized data transfers beyond the scope of works agreements](https://www.heuking.de/en/news-events/newsletter-articles/detail/damages-under-the-gdpr-due-to-testing-of-cloud-based-hr-software.html) can lead to damages claims, even when the violation seems minor.

## **The €200 That Could Cost You Millions**

While €200 might seem insignificant, this ruling establishes a precedent that could expose your organization to far greater risks:

**Scalability Risk**: If multiple employees are affected by similar violations, damages could multiply rapidly across your workforce.

**Regulatory Attention**: Court-confirmed GDPR violations often trigger regulatory investigations, potentially leading to administrative fines up to 4% of annual global turnover.

**Reputational Impact**: Public court decisions about data protection violations can severely damage employer brand and employee trust.

## **Are You Making These Critical Mistakes?**

Based on this ruling and similar cases, ask yourself:

- Does your works agreement explicitly cover cloud-based HR software testing?

- Have you conducted a [Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments-dpias/what-is-a-dpia/) for your HR software testing? (A DPIA is a process designed to help you systematically analyze, identify and minimize the data protection risks of a project or plan)

- Are you using anonymized or pseudonymized data for testing, or real employee information?

- Do your cloud service agreements include adequate data protection safeguards?

- Have you verified that data transfers comply with GDPR's international transfer requirements?

If you answered "no" or "I'm not sure" to any of these questions, your organization may be at risk.

## **What You Must Do Now**

The German Federal Labour Court's decision provides a clear roadmap for compliance:

- **Review Your Works Agreements**: Ensure they explicitly address cloud-based HR software testing and comply with all [GDPR requirements](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/).

- **Implement Robust Legal Safeguards**: Don't rely on internal agreements alone—establish comprehensive technical and organizational measures.

- **Conduct Proper Risk Assessments**: Perform [DPIAs](https://gdpr.eu/data-protection-impact-assessment-template/) before implementing or testing new HR systems.

- **Limit Data Transfers**: Use the minimum necessary data for testing purposes and ensure all transfers have proper legal basis.

In the era of cloud-based solutions for everything, compliance isn't just about having the right policies - it's about implementing them correctly at every stage, especially during testing phases when organizations are most vulnerable to violations.

The question isn't whether your HR software testing practices will face scrutiny - it's whether you'll be ready when they do.
