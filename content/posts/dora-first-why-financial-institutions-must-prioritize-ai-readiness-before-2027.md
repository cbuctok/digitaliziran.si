Are you prepared for the regulatory storm heading toward financial services? While your competitors scramble to understand the [EU AI Act](https://www.artificial-intelligence-act.com/), smart institutions are taking a "DORA first" approach - and it might be the difference between thriving and merely surviving the 2027 compliance deadline.

## The Perfect Storm: When DORA Meets AI Act

The [Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)](https://www.mofo.com/resources/insights/250218-european-digital-compliance-key-digital-regulation-compliance), which became applicable on **January 17, 2025**, has already transformed how financial institutions manage [ICT risk](https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/trm/ict-risk-management-under-dora) (Information and Communication Technology risks that could compromise network and information systems). Now, with the [EU AI Act's full enforcement approaching August 2, 2027](https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2024/10/eu-standardization-supporting-the-artificial-intelligence-act), institutions face an unprecedented convergence of regulatory requirements.

Here's what makes this particularly challenging: **AI-driven financial tools must comply with both AI Act obligations (transparency, bias mitigation, accuracy testing) and DORA's ICT risk management standards**. This isn't just about meeting two separate regulations - it's about creating integrated compliance frameworks that address both technological resilience and AI governance simultaneously.

## Why "DORA First" Makes Strategic Sense

Think of DORA as your foundation. By establishing robust [ICT risk management frameworks](https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/trm/ict-risk-management-under-dora) first, you're building the infrastructure necessary to support AI compliance later. This approach offers several critical advantages:

**Operational Resilience Foundation**: DORA's emphasis on operational resilience creates the stable technological environment necessary for deploying AI systems safely and compliantly.

**Risk Management Integration**: DORA's [risk assessment methodologies](https://www.staffordglobal.org/blog/financial-risk-management/) can be extended to cover AI-specific risks, creating unified governance structures rather than siloed compliance efforts.

**Data Quality Assurance**: DORA's data management requirements establish the high-quality data foundations that AI systems desperately need to function effectively and meet transparency obligations.

## The High-Risk Reality for Financial Services

Financial institutions face particular scrutiny under the AI Act because many of their AI applications fall into high-risk categories. [Credit scoring, fraud detection, and customer assessment systems](https://www.goodwinlaw.com/en/insights/publications/2024/08/alerts-practices-pif-key-points-for-financial-services-businesses) all require strict compliance with [transparency and explainability requirements](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai).

For readers unfamiliar with these terms: [**Explainable AI (XAI)**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai) refers to artificial intelligence systems that can provide clear, understandable explanations for their decisions and recommendations. This is crucial in financial services where customers and regulators need to understand why certain decisions (like loan approvals or fraud alerts) were made.

The stakes couldn't be higher: [non-compliance with the EU AI Act can result in fines up to €35 million or 7% of total worldwide annual turnover](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/the-eu-ai-act-pioneering-the-future-of-ai-regulation/). Combined with DORA's enforcement mechanisms, the financial exposure is substantial.

## Your Five-Dimensional Readiness Framework

Successful preparation requires addressing AI readiness across multiple dimensions:

**Technological Readiness**: Ensure your infrastructure can support both DORA's resilience requirements and AI Act's technical obligations, including [explainability and bias testing capabilities](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai).

**Data Governance**: Establish data quality frameworks that satisfy both DORA's operational requirements and AI Act's [transparency mandates](https://www.f5.com/company/blog/crucial-concepts-in-ai-transparency-and-explainability).

**Customer Experience**: Design AI interactions that meet transparency requirements while maintaining the seamless experiences customers expect.

**Compliance Integration**: Create unified governance structures that address both regulations without creating conflicting requirements or duplicated efforts.

**Security Architecture**: Implement security measures that protect both operational resilience (DORA) and AI system integrity (AI Act).

## Taking Action: Your Next Steps

The window for proactive preparation is narrowing. Organizations that start now with a DORA-first approach will have significant advantages:

- **Conduct integrated readiness assessments** that evaluate both DORA compliance status and AI Act preparation needs

- **Establish unified governance frameworks** that address both operational resilience and AI governance

- **Invest in [explainable AI technologies](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai)** that can meet transparency requirements while maintaining competitive performance

- **Develop staff competencies** in both [ICT risk management](https://www.leanix.net/en/wiki/trm/ict-risk-management-under-dora) and AI governance

## The Competitive Advantage of Early Action

While compliance might seem like a burden, early adopters are discovering significant competitive advantages. Robust AI governance frameworks improve decision-making quality, reduce operational risks, and enhance customer trust. Organizations that embrace these requirements proactively often find they've built superior operational capabilities that extend far beyond mere compliance.

The question isn't whether you'll need to comply with both DORA and the AI Act- it's whether you'll be ready when full enforcement arrives in 2027. Those taking a "DORA first" approach today are positioning themselves not just for compliance, but for competitive advantage in an AI-driven financial services landscape.

**Are you building on solid foundations, or are you planning to construct your AI compliance framework on shifting sand?**
