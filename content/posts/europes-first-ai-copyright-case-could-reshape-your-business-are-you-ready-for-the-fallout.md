Is your company using AI tools to generate content, analyze data, or automate processes? The [European Court of Justice (ECJ)](https://european-union.europa.eu/institutions-law-budget/institutions-and-bodies/search-all-eu-institutions-and-bodies/court-justice-european-union-cjeu_en) has just received its first referral concerning [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and [copyright law](https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/) - and the outcome could fundamentally change how you operate.

## The Case That Could Change Everything

The landmark case, Like Company versus Google Ireland, centers on a critical question: when [AI systems](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/AI-system-artificial-intelligence-system) generate outputs that reproduce or resemble [copyrighted works](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/copyright.asp), does this constitute [copyright infringement](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-definitions.html#infringement) under [European Union (EU) law](https://european-union.europa.eu/law_en)? [This isn't just another legal dispute](https://www.stephensonharwood.com/insights/cjeu-to-rule-on-ai-and-copyright-in-a-landmark-case-against-google) - it's the first time Europe's highest court will definitively rule on how copyright law applies to [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence).

The case specifically examines whether training AI models on protected works falls within existing exceptions like [text and data mining](https://www.copyrightuser.org/understand/text-data-mining/), and crucially, how liability for AI-generated content should be assigned. With a ruling expected by 2027, businesses across Europe are watching nervously.

## Why Your Business Should Care

If you're using AI tools for content creation, market research, or customer communications, this ruling could directly impact your operations. The court's decision will clarify:

- **Training Data Liability**: Whether using copyrighted material to train AI models constitutes infringement

- **Output Responsibility**: Who bears liability when AI generates content similar to existing copyrighted works

- **Commercial Use Boundaries**: How businesses can legally deploy AI-generated content

## The Insurance Perspective: Risk Is Manageable

While the legal uncertainty might seem daunting, [AI risks are increasingly manageable through proper insurance coverage](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/insuring-ai-risks-is-your-business-already-covered). Many existing [business insurance policies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/business-insurance.asp) already provide some protection for AI-related liabilities, though specific AI insurance products are rapidly evolving to address these emerging risks.

## A Critical Warning: Don't Go It Alone

Here's what you absolutely must not do: attempt to navigate these complex legal waters using AI legal tools. [As legal experts emphasize](https://www.clarilis.com/blog/why-genai-still-needs-a-good-lawyer), [generative AI](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/generative-AI) cannot replace the nuanced thinking and professional judgment that qualified lawyers provide. While AI can assist in creating drafts quickly, it lacks the critical analysis needed for complex legal compliance.

The irony is stark - as we await definitive guidance on AI and copyright law, the tools at the center of the controversy cannot adequately help you prepare for the legal implications.

## What You Should Do Now

Don't wait until 2027 for clarity. Start preparing today by:

- **Auditing your AI usage**: Document which AI tools your organization uses and how

- **Reviewing your insurance coverage**: Ensure your policies address AI-related risks

- **Consulting qualified legal counsel**: Get professional guidance on your specific AI implementations

- **Establishing clear AI governance policies**: Create frameworks for responsible AI use

The ECJ's ruling will set the precedent for AI and copyright across Europe, potentially influencing global standards. The question isn't whether this will affect your business - it's whether you'll be prepared when it does.
