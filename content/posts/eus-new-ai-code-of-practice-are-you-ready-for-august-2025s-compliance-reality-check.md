Is your organization prepared for the seismic shift coming to AI governance this August? The European Commission has just published its voluntary [General-Purpose AI Code of Practice (GPAI-CoP)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/contents-code-gpai), and while "voluntary" might sound reassuring, the practical reality is far more complex.

## The August 2025 Deadline That Changes Everything

When the [EU AI Act takes full effect on August 2, 2025](https://www.dlapiper.com/en-us/insights/publications/2025/07/european-union-published-code-of-practice), your AI systems will face unprecedented scrutiny. The newly published code provides a roadmap for compliance, but it also reveals the technical challenges ahead - particularly around **fairness**, which experts describe as ["an important and technically challenging aspect of AI."](https://www.lewissilkin.com/insights/2025/07/18/european-commission-consults-on-digital-fairness-act-102ku4t)

However, it's important to note that significant progress has been made in developing [fairness-aware algorithms and bias mitigation techniques](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-12/aieg-ati-fairness_1.pdf). Organizations like the [Alan Turing Institute have published comprehensive guidelines](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/turing-commons/skills-tracks/aeg/chapter4/bias/) and tools to address fairness in AI, indicating that the field is actively working on practical solutions.

## Why "Voluntary" Doesn't Mean Optional

While the GPAI-CoP doesn't grant legal presumption of conformity, it standardizes approaches and clarifies requirements that AI providers must meet. Think of it as the EU's blueprint for what compliance looks like in practice. This approach mirrors how [GDPR guidelines](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) were initially voluntary but became the de facto standard for compliance. Organizations ignoring these guidelines do so at their own peril.

The code emphasizes three critical pillars:

- **Transparency**: Your AI systems must be explainable to users and regulators

- **Copyright compliance**: Training data and outputs must respect [intellectual property rights](https://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/)

- **Safety and risk management**: Comprehensive frameworks for identifying and mitigating AI risks

## The Documentation Challenge That's Catching Everyone Off Guard

[Industry experts are raising concerns](https://www.heuking.de/en/news-events/newsletter-articles/detail/ai-act-new-code-of-practice-for-general-purpose-ai-models-by-the-eu-commission-under-discussion.html) about the extensive documentation requirements and their potential impact on smaller companies. The code demands clear operational guidance and differentiation between various AI systems - a level of granularity that many organizations haven't considered.

While this presents challenges, it's worth noting that many industries already have robust documentation practices due to other regulatory requirements. For example, the medical device industry successfully complies with stringent documentation standards under regulations like the [FDA's Quality System Regulation](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/postmarket-requirements-devices/quality-system-qsr-regulation-part-820). Organizations can leverage these existing frameworks as a foundation for AI compliance.

For smaller companies, this presents a particular challenge: how do you demonstrate compliance without the resources of tech giants? The answer lies in early preparation, strategic planning, and potentially adopting existing [AI governance frameworks](https://www.turing.ac.uk/data-protection-ai-and-fairness) that many organizations are already integrating into their operations.

## Addressing the Transparency Paradox

The article emphasizes the need for AI systems to be explainable, and while transparency is crucial, it's important to acknowledge the limitations. Some complex AI models, particularly [deep learning systems](https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning), are inherently '[black boxes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackbox.asp),' making complete transparency challenging. However, research is ongoing to develop methods for better [interpretability](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/), and organizations shouldn't let perfect transparency become the enemy of good governance.

## Three Questions Every AI User Must Answer Now

Before August 2025 arrives, your organization needs definitive answers to:

-

**Can you explain your AI decisions?** Transparency isn't just about having documentation—it's about providing meaningful explanations that satisfy both customers and regulators. While complete transparency may not always be possible, organizations can implement [explainable AI techniques](https://www.ibm.com/watson/explainable-ai) to improve interpretability.

-

**Do you understand your liability exposure?** When AI systems make decisions or generate content, who bears responsibility for the outcomes? While this is a complex issue with an evolving legal framework, existing [product liability laws](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/dealing-with-customers/consumer-contracts-guarantees/product-liability/index_en.htm) and corporate governance principles provide a foundation for addressing these concerns. The EU's Product Liability Directive is being reviewed to include provisions for AI systems.

-

**Are your governance frameworks AI-ready?** Traditional compliance structures may not address the unique challenges of AI systems, but many organizations are already adapting their governance frameworks to include AI-specific considerations. Examples include integrating [AI ethics boards](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/algorithmic-accountability-for-the-public-sector/) and using ethical impact assessments.

## The Strategic Advantage of Acting Now

Organizations that embrace these requirements proactively aren't just avoiding risks - they're building competitive advantages. This is supported by evidence from other industries where early adopters of regulatory standards often gain market trust and leadership positions. Companies that proactively complied with GDPR, for example, have seen increased consumer trust and loyalty.

Robust AI governance frameworks improve decision-making quality, reduce operational risks, and enhance customer trust. The window for reactive compliance is rapidly closing. With enforcement approaching and the technical complexity becoming clearer, the preparation decisions you make today will determine your competitive position tomorrow.

## Building on Existing Foundations

While the AI Act presents new challenges, organizations shouldn't feel they're starting from scratch. The AI community is actively developing solutions to address fairness, transparency, and governance. Many existing [risk management frameworks](https://www.iso.org/iso-31000-risk-management.html) can be adapted for AI-specific considerations, and resources like the [Turing Institute's AI Fairness in Practice guide](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-12/aieg-ati-fairness_1.pdf) provide practical, actionable guidance.

Are you building your AI strategy on solid regulatory foundations, or are you gambling with your organization's future? The choice - and the consequences - are entirely yours.

But remember: **you're not alone** in this journey, and the tools and frameworks to succeed are increasingly available.
