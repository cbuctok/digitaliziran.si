Building on the understanding of the "Ironies of GenAI," recent research went deeper into the specific cognitive impacts of these powerful tools, particularly on **critical thinking**. A 2025 study, "[The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking: Self-Reported Reductions in Cognitive Effort and Confidence Effects From a Survey of Knowledge Workers](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf)," provides crucial insights into this domain.

The study found that while GenAI can enhance efficiency, it also introduces significant shifts in how knowledge workers engage in critical thinking. One key finding revolves around **"Confidence Effects"**: higher confidence in GenAI's ability to perform a task is associated with less critical thinking, even though users might perceive it as less effortful. Conversely, higher self-confidence in one's own ability to do the task is linked to more critical thinking, often accompanied by a perception of greater effort. This suggests a risk of **over-reliance** on AI, where users may accept outputs without sufficient critical evaluation, potentially leading to errors and a decline in independent problem-solving skills.

The study also identified specific shifts in the effort associated with different cognitive activities:

- For **knowledge recall and comprehension**, effort moves from information gathering to the often crucial task of **information verification**.

- In **application**, the focus shifts from direct problem-solving to **integrating AI-generated responses** effectively into the user's workflow.

- For **analysis, synthesis, and evaluation**, effort transitions from direct task execution to **task stewardship**, involving guiding the AI, steering its responses, and ensuring the final output meets required quality standards.

Furthermore, the research uncovered various **motivators and inhibitors** for engaging in critical thinking when using GenAI. Motivators include the desire for improved work quality, avoidance of negative outcomes, and skill development. Inhibitors range from a lack of awareness of the need for critical thinking and limited motivation due to time pressure or job scope, to difficulties in inspecting and improving AI responses.

These findings underscore that the integration of GenAI is not a simple productivity enhancer. It fundamentally alters the cognitive landscape of knowledge work, demanding a conscious effort to cultivate and adapt critical thinking skills in this new human-AI dynamic.
