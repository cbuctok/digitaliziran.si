Fast forward to the era of **Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)**, and we see a striking resemblance to the "Ironies of Automation." A 2024 study, "[Ironies of Generative AI: Understanding and mitigating productivity loss in human-AI interactions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11364)," explicitly draws on this decades-long Human Factors research to understand the challenges emerging with GenAI systems. While GenAI promises to boost productivity in various knowledge-intensive domains like programming and writing, numerous studies reveal users working ineffectively with these systems and experiencing productivity losses.

The researchers highlight four key reasons for productivity loss with GenAI, echoing the earlier observations about automation:

- **The Production-to-Evaluation Shift:** Similar to how automation shifted manual control to monitoring, GenAI moves users from producing content to evaluating AI-generated outputs. This evaluation can be cognitively demanding, requiring users to proofread, debug, and validate AI suggestions, sometimes at the expense of other productive tasks. Programmers, for instance, have described working with AI code completion tools as feeling like a "proofreading task".

- **Unhelpful Workflow Restructuring:** The introduction of GenAI often restructures familiar workflows in ways that hinder productivity. New tasks like prompt engineering and output adaptation emerge, requiring significant time and cognitive effort. The familiar sequence of task steps can be disrupted by AI suggestions, and critical feedback can be lost when AI outputs lack context.

- **Task Interruptions:** GenAI systems, particularly through features like auto-suggestions, frequently interrupt users during their primary tasks. These interruptions can disrupt thought processes, break flow states, and necessitate task switching, all of which negatively impact performance. Long and complex suggestions can be particularly distracting.

- **Task-Complexity Polarization:** Automation often makes easy tasks easier but can paradoxically make hard tasks even harder. GenAI systems tend to be most effective with simpler tasks like writing boilerplate code, but can lead to more task failures in medium and hard tasks, sometimes even introducing subtle errors that are difficult to detect.

These parallels underscore the importance of learning from the history of human-automation interaction. The "Ironies of Generative AI" demonstrate that the usability challenges are not entirely novel and that Human Factors research offers valuable insights for designing more effective human-AI interactions.
