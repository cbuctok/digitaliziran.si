As organizations increasingly adopt AI-powered tools, Google's NotebookLM Plus has emerged as a valuable resource for businesses. However, many users encounter access issues due to specific licensing and configuration requirements. After an in-depth troubleshooting session with a Google representative, we've compiled a comprehensive guide to help you navigate these requirements.

## Key Requirements for NotebookLM Plus Access

### Licensing Prerequisites

The foundation of NotebookLM Plus access lies in proper licensing. Here's what you need to know:

- A Google Workspace Business Standard license or higher (Business, Education, or Enterprise) is mandatory

- Workspace Essentials license is not sufficient for access

- Gemini for Business Standard (or higher) license is required

- Both the Business and Gemini licenses must be specifically assigned to the user

### Domain Configuration Requirements

Your domain setup plays a crucial role in accessing NotebookLM Plus:

- Domain name must be added and verified in your Google Workspace

- Gmail services must be activated for your domain

- NotebookLM service needs to be activated under "other services"

- For organizations with multiple units, ensure the service is activated for the specific organizational unit of the user

## Important Note for Essentials Users

If you're currently on an Essentials license and want to access NotebookLM Plus, be aware of this critical upgrade path:

- You must first upgrade to Enterprise Essentials

- From there, you can then transition to your desired license tier

- Direct upgrades from Essentials to Business are not possible

## Verification Steps

To ensure you have proper access, verify that:

- Your account has the correct license tier (Business Standard or higher)

- Gemini for Business Standard is properly licensed and assigned

- Your domain is verified and has Gmail activated

- NotebookLM service is enabled for your organizational unit

## Footnote

Remember to work with your IT administrator to verify these settings, as many require administrative access to implement or modify.
