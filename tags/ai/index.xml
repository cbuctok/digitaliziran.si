&lt;h2 id="the-pitch-vs-the-spreadsheet"&gt;The Pitch vs. The Spreadsheet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve seen the headlines. You&amp;rsquo;ve attended the boardroom presentations. Some consultant with expensive slides told you AI will &amp;ldquo;transform your workforce&amp;rdquo; and you nodded along while mentally calculating severance packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start drafting those redundancy letters, let&amp;rsquo;s talk numbers. Not the shiny projected ones. The real ones.&lt;/p&gt;

Complex workflows collapsed into a few buttons. The distance between &amp;ldquo;I want this&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; is approaching zero. Soon we&amp;rsquo;ll be generating things through neural interfaces paired with AI agents. (Screenshot this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now everyone can make anything - and everyone does. Content factories pump out AI-generated slop at industrial scale. Algorithms lock us into bubbles of perfectly curated comfort: soft, familiar, frictionless. Reels, shorts, endless scroll. Attention has become reflexive.

&lt;h2 id="the-regulatory-earthquake-you-cant-ignore"&gt;The Regulatory Earthquake You Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 19 November 2025, the European Commission released two proposed regulations that will fundamentally reshape how businesses handle data, AI, and cybersecurity in Europe. The Digital Omnibus (2025/0360) and Digital Omnibus on AI (2025/0359) aren&amp;rsquo;t minor tweaks - they&amp;rsquo;re a complete rethinking of the EU&amp;rsquo;s approach to digital regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hamburg's €492,000 Fine Signals New Era of AI Transparency Enforcement: Are You Ready?</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/10/09/hamburgs-e492000-fine-signals-new-era-of-ai-transparency-enforcement-are-you-ready/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 08:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/10/09/hamburgs-e492000-fine-signals-new-era-of-ai-transparency-enforcement-are-you-ready/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Is your organization using &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/"&gt;automated decision-making systems&lt;/a&gt; without fully understanding the transparency requirements?

&lt;p&gt;The Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information (HmbBfDI) imposed this substantial penalty on a financial company for failing to provide adequate transparency in automated credit card application decisions.

A UK &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/courts-and-tribunals/tribunals/first-tier-tribunal/"&gt;First-Tier Tribunal&lt;/a&gt; judge recently provided a notable answer, becoming one of the first to openly disclose using AI in drafting a judicial decision - and the implications extend far beyond the legal profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-scale-of-exposure"&gt;The Scale of Exposure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco&amp;rsquo;s research team discovered numerous Ollama servers - a popular platform for running LLMs locally - exposed to the internet without proper security controls. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that &lt;strong&gt;Ollama is designed with secure defaults&lt;/strong&gt;. By default, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/11941"&gt;Ollama binds only to localhost (127.0.0.1)&lt;/a&gt;, restricting access to the local machine only. The exposures identified by Cisco&amp;rsquo;s research occur when administrators deliberately override these secure defaults by setting the &lt;code&gt;OLLAMA_HOST&lt;/code&gt; environment variable to &lt;code&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/code&gt; to enable remote access, but fail to implement proper security measures.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Are You Ready for Your Robot Teammate?

This isn&amp;rsquo;t science fiction; it&amp;rsquo;s the reality of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050924003223"&gt;Industry 5.0&lt;/a&gt;, where human-robot collaboration is transforming workplaces across manufacturing, healthcare, and service industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-shift-from-automation-to-collaboration"&gt;The Shift from Automation to Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional &lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/robotics"&gt;industrial robots&lt;/a&gt; confined behind safety barriers, &lt;strong&gt;collaborative robots (cobots)&lt;/strong&gt; are engineered to work in shared spaces with humans. According to recent research from &lt;a href="https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/computingengineering/article/25/5/050301/1213609/Special-Issue-Human-Robot-Collaboration-in"&gt;ASME Digital Collection&lt;/a&gt;, the proper design of individual and joint tasks for humans and cobots can maximize collaborative potential, creating more efficient and adaptable work environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The AI Security Crisis You Can't Ignore: Why Simon Willison's 'Lethal Trifecta' Demands Immediate Action</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/08/27/the-ai-security-crisis-you-cant-ignore-why-simon-willisons-lethal-trifecta-demands-immediate-action/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 07:26:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/08/27/the-ai-security-crisis-you-cant-ignore-why-simon-willisons-lethal-trifecta-demands-immediate-action/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are your AI systems creating a perfect storm for data theft? Security researcher &lt;a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/"&gt;Simon Willison&amp;rsquo;s recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; reveals a chilling reality: AI agents combining three specific capabilities create what he calls the &amp;ldquo;lethal trifecta&amp;rdquo; – a combination so dangerous that attackers can easily trick systems into accessing private data and sending it directly to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-three-components-that-spell-disaster"&gt;The Three Components That Spell Disaster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Willison identifies three seemingly innocent AI capabilities that, when combined, become a security nightmare:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI Safety vs. Security: The Critical Distinction Your Organization Can't Afford to Ignore</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/08/26/ai-safety-vs-security-the-critical-distinction-your-organization-cant-afford-to-ignore/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 10:21:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/08/26/ai-safety-vs-security-the-critical-distinction-your-organization-cant-afford-to-ignore/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you treating &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-safety"&gt;AI safety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-ai-for-cybersecurity"&gt;AI security&lt;/a&gt; as the same thing?

&lt;p&gt;While many languages use the same word for both concepts, &lt;a href="https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/when-it-comes-to-ai-incidents-safety-and-security-are-not-the-same"&gt;the OECD emphasizes that AI safety and security are distinct yet interconnected domains&lt;/a&gt; that require different approaches and frameworks.
