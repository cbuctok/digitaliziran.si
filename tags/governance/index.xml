Complex workflows collapsed into a few buttons. The distance between &amp;ldquo;I want this&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; is approaching zero. Soon we&amp;rsquo;ll be generating things through neural interfaces paired with AI agents. (Screenshot this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now everyone can make anything - and everyone does. Content factories pump out AI-generated slop at industrial scale. Algorithms lock us into bubbles of perfectly curated comfort: soft, familiar, frictionless. Reels, shorts, endless scroll. Attention has become reflexive. In this ocean of noise, good ideas drown as quickly as bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI Safety vs. Security: The Critical Distinction Your Organization Can't Afford to Ignore</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/08/26/ai-safety-vs-security-the-critical-distinction-your-organization-cant-afford-to-ignore/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 10:21:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/08/26/ai-safety-vs-security-the-critical-distinction-your-organization-cant-afford-to-ignore/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you treating &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-safety"&gt;AI safety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-ai-for-cybersecurity"&gt;AI security&lt;/a&gt; as the same thing? If so, your organization might be missing critical vulnerabilities that could compromise both your operations and compliance posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-dangerous-misconception"&gt;The Dangerous Misconception&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many languages use the same word for both concepts, &lt;a href="https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/when-it-comes-to-ai-incidents-safety-and-security-are-not-the-same"&gt;the OECD emphasizes that AI safety and security are distinct yet interconnected domains&lt;/a&gt; that require different approaches and frameworks. This distinction isn&amp;rsquo;t just academic - it has real implications for how you protect your organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
