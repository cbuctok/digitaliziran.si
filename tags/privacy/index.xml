A &lt;a href="https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=E541D6943FA2B3D1E87A0FCA78DCF7D7?text=&amp;amp;docid=306764&amp;amp;pageIndex=0&amp;amp;doclang=EN&amp;amp;mode=req&amp;amp;dir=&amp;amp;occ=first&amp;amp;part=1&amp;amp;cid=15422674"&gt;landmark ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Russmedia Digital&lt;/em&gt; (C-492/23) just fundamentally changed how platforms must handle &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data/"&gt;personal data&lt;/a&gt; - and the compliance burden is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="marketplaces-are-now-data-controllers"&gt;Marketplaces Are Now Data Controllers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en"&gt;Court&lt;/a&gt; ruled that marketplace operators qualify as &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/"&gt;data controllers&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/a&gt; for personal data contained in user-posted listings - even when platforms neither create the content nor know the advertiser&amp;rsquo;s identity. The rationale? By deciding to make listings public and exploiting them commercially, platforms exercise control over personal data processing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>EU Digital Omnibus Drops: Is Your Compliance Strategy About to Become Obsolete?</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/11/25/eu-digital-omnibus-drops-is-your-compliance-strategy-about-to-become-obsolete/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2025 12:30:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/11/25/eu-digital-omnibus-drops-is-your-compliance-strategy-about-to-become-obsolete/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you still building your compliance framework around the current GDPR, AI Act, and Data Act requirements? The European Commission just published the most sweeping reform of EU digital laws since 2018 - and everything you thought you knew about data protection compliance might be about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-regulatory-earthquake-you-cant-ignore"&gt;The Regulatory Earthquake You Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 19 November 2025, the European Commission released two proposed regulations that will fundamentally reshape how businesses handle data, AI, and cybersecurity in Europe. The Digital Omnibus (2025/0360) and Digital Omnibus on AI (2025/0359) aren&amp;rsquo;t minor tweaks - they&amp;rsquo;re a complete rethinking of the EU&amp;rsquo;s approach to digital regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Are Your AI Agents Legally Compliant?

While competitors rush to automate processes with intelligent agents, smart organizations are discovering that regulatory compliance - not just functionality - determines long-term success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-multi-framework-challenge-thats-catching-everyone-off-guard"&gt;The Multi-Framework Challenge That&amp;rsquo;s Catching Everyone Off Guard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/resources/articles/ai-agent/"&gt;AI agents&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t operate in a regulatory vacuum. Unlike traditional software, these autonomous systems must simultaneously comply with multiple overlapping frameworks that create unprecedented complexity for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>EU Data Act Countdown: 30 Days Left to Comply – Is Your Business Ready for September 12?</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/08/14/eu-data-act-countdown-30-days-left-to-comply-is-your-business-ready-for-september-12/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 07:13:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/08/14/eu-data-act-countdown-30-days-left-to-comply-is-your-business-ready-for-september-12/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you prepared for the most significant data regulation since &lt;a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/"&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt;? With just 30 days remaining until the &lt;a href="https://www.loyensloeff.com/insights/news--events/news/the-eu-data-act-takes/"&gt;EU Data Act&lt;/a&gt; becomes applicable on September 12, 2025, companies across Europe are scrambling to understand requirements that will fundamentally reshape how they handle &lt;a href="https://www.arm.com/glossary/connected-devices"&gt;connected device&lt;/a&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The EU Data Act entered into force on January 11, 2024, giving companies nearly two years to prepare. However, its obligations only become legally enforceable starting September 12, 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Microsoft Admits It Cannot Guarantee EU Data Sovereignty: Is Your Organization at Risk?</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/07/30/microsoft-admits-it-cannot-guarantee-eu-data-sovereignty-is-your-organization-at-risk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 14:34:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/07/30/microsoft-admits-it-cannot-guarantee-eu-data-sovereignty-is-your-organization-at-risk/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you confident your European data is truly protected from foreign surveillance?&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s recent admission under oath has raised important questions about data sovereignty, but the full picture is more nuanced than initial headlines suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-uncomfortable-truth---and-microsofts-response"&gt;The Uncomfortable Truth - And Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has publicly acknowledged that it &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/25/microsoft_admits_it_cannot_guarantee/"&gt;cannot guarantee data sovereignty&lt;/a&gt; for customers in France and, by extension, the wider European Union. This admission came during legal proceedings where Microsoft France&amp;rsquo;s General Counsel, Anton Carniaux, confirmed the company&amp;rsquo;s inability to resist US government data requests under the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/cloud-act-resources"&gt;US CLOUD Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Your Work Emails Are Personal Data: The GDPR Ruling That Changes Everything</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/26/your-work-emails-are-personal-data-the-gdpr-ruling-that-changes-everything/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 14:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/26/your-work-emails-are-personal-data-the-gdpr-ruling-that-changes-everything/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you think your professional emails belong to your employer? Think again. A recent legal clarification has confirmed that &lt;strong&gt;professional emails can contain personal data under the &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - but the reality is more nuanced than many headlines suggest, and this ruling could fundamentally change how your workplace handles your communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-ruling-that-matters---with-important-caveats"&gt;The Ruling That Matters - With Important Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.applebyglobal.com/publications/professional-emails-are-personal-data/"&gt;Appleby Global&amp;rsquo;s recent analysis&lt;/a&gt;, professional emails can fall under GDPR protection as &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/personal-information-what-is-it/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/"&gt;personal data&lt;/a&gt;.

A landmark ruling by Germany&amp;rsquo;s Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht) should make you pause and reconsider your approach. The court awarded €200 in damages to an employee whose personal data was improperly transferred during cloud-based HR software testing - and this decision could reshape how companies handle employee data across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-case-that-changes-everything"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Case That Changes Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involved an employee whose personal data was transferred to &lt;a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/news/germany-federal-labor-court-allows-non-material"&gt;Workday&lt;/a&gt; HR management software beyond the agreed limits of a concluded works agreement (a formal contract between employer and employee that defines terms and conditions of employment).

Far from being the revolutionary protocol its proponents claim, MCP may represent a significant security vulnerability that could compromise sensitive data and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCP purports to facilitate communication between language models and external tools, creating a standardized way for AI systems to access data sources and execute functions. However, as detailed in a recent analysis, this so-called &amp;ldquo;protocol&amp;rdquo; is more accurately described as a scheme that lacks fundamental security safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>EU's ProtectEU Plan Sparks Privacy Concerns: The Hidden Cost of Backdoored Encryption</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/04/07/eus-protecteu-plan-sparks-privacy-concerns-the-hidden-cost-of-backdoored-encryption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 08:52:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/04/07/eus-protecteu-plan-sparks-privacy-concerns-the-hidden-cost-of-backdoored-encryption/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In a move that has sent shockwaves through the cybersecurity community, &lt;a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-presents-protecteu-internal-security-strategy-2025-04-01_en"&gt;the European Union&amp;rsquo;s ProtectEU&lt;/a&gt; plan has revealed ambitious proposals to implement encryption backdoors by 2026.

&lt;p&gt;The plan, which extends far beyond encryption concerns, encompasses several significant initiatives. At its core, the proposal aims to enhance law enforcement capabilities, particularly in fighting serious crimes and child sexual abuse.
