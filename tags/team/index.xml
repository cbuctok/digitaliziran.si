The Critical Role Reshaping Corporate Governance</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/09/22/is-your-organization-ready-for-the-ai-officer-revolution-the-critical-role-reshaping-corporate-governance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 10:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/09/22/is-your-organization-ready-for-the-ai-officer-revolution-the-critical-role-reshaping-corporate-governance/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you prepared for the executive role that&amp;rsquo;s quietly becoming one of the most discussed positions in modern corporate governance? While companies scramble to implement &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; solutions, a new breed of executive is emerging to navigate the complex intersection of technology, ethics, and regulatory compliance: the AI Officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-rise-of-the-ai-officer-more-than-just-another-c-suite-title"&gt;The Rise of the AI Officer: More Than Just Another C-Suite Title&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI Officer role represents a significant shift in how organizations approach artificial intelligence governance. Unlike traditional technology roles, &lt;a href="https://www.vantedgesearch.com/resources/blogs-the-caio-emergence-why-the-chief-ai-officer-is-todays-critical-c-suite-role/"&gt;AI Officers concentrate accountability for value creation and risk control&lt;/a&gt; that was previously scattered across IT, data, and business units.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Your Work Emails Are Personal Data: The GDPR Ruling That Changes Everything</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/26/your-work-emails-are-personal-data-the-gdpr-ruling-that-changes-everything/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2025 14:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/26/your-work-emails-are-personal-data-the-gdpr-ruling-that-changes-everything/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you think your professional emails belong to your employer? Think again. A recent legal clarification has confirmed that &lt;strong&gt;professional emails can contain personal data under the &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - but the reality is more nuanced than many headlines suggest, and this ruling could fundamentally change how your workplace handles your communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-ruling-that-matters---with-important-caveats"&gt;The Ruling That Matters - With Important Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.applebyglobal.com/publications/professional-emails-are-personal-data/"&gt;Appleby Global&amp;rsquo;s recent analysis&lt;/a&gt;, professional emails can fall under GDPR protection as &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/personal-information-what-is-it/what-is-personal-data/what-is-personal-data/"&gt;personal data&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to understand that not all professional emails automatically qualify as personal data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cloud-based software testing for 200€/employee</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/10/cloud-based-software-testing-for-200e-employee/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2025 12:54:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/10/cloud-based-software-testing-for-200e-employee/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Are you testing new HR software in your organization? A landmark ruling by Germany&amp;rsquo;s Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht) should make you pause and reconsider your approach. The court awarded €200 in damages to an employee whose personal data was improperly transferred during cloud-based HR software testing - and this decision could reshape how companies handle employee data across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-case-that-changes-everything"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Case That Changes Everything&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involved an employee whose personal data was transferred to &lt;a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/news/germany-federal-labor-court-allows-non-material"&gt;Workday&lt;/a&gt; HR management software beyond the agreed limits of a concluded works agreement (a formal contract between employer and employee that defines terms and conditions of employment). What makes this ruling particularly significant is that the court confirmed that even limited misuse of employee data can trigger liability under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Is Your Team Ready for AI? Why Education Must Come Before Implementation</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/02/is-your-team-ready-for-ai-why-education-must-come-before-implementation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 08:35:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/06/02/is-your-team-ready-for-ai-why-education-must-come-before-implementation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Picture this: your organization just invested in cutting-edge AI technology, but your team doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand how it works, when it might fail, or what legal obligations come with its use. Sound familiar? You&amp;rsquo;re not alone—and you&amp;rsquo;re potentially in violation of the &lt;a href="https://www.lexia.it/en/2025/05/30/ai-literacy-and-faqs/"&gt;European AI Act&lt;/a&gt;, which mandates AI literacy training as of February 2, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-knowledge-first-imperative"&gt;The Knowledge-First Imperative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle is simple yet revolutionary: &lt;strong&gt;knowledge is power, and it&amp;rsquo;s crucial for successful AI integration to have educated personnel first, not after integration&lt;/strong&gt;. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just good practice—it&amp;rsquo;s now a legal requirement under EU regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CEOs as Data Protection Officers: The €5,000 Mistake Your Company Might Be Making</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/05/23/ceos-as-data-protection-officers-the-e5000-mistake-your-company-might-be-making/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 07:35:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/05/23/ceos-as-data-protection-officers-the-e5000-mistake-your-company-might-be-making/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Is your CEO wearing too many hats? If one of those happens to be Data Protection Officer (DPO), your organization could be facing &lt;a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Dsk/DSBT_20241016_2024_0_641_771_00/DSBT_20241016_2024_0_641_771_00.pdf"&gt;significant legal and compliance risks&lt;/a&gt;—as one company discovered after being hit with a €5,000 fine by Austria&amp;rsquo;s data protection authority (DSB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DSB penalized a company for appointing its managing director as its Data Protection Officer, highlighting a fundamental conflict of interest that violates core principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Cognitive Impact - How GenAI Reshapes Critical Thinking</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/04/11/the-cognitive-impact-how-genai-reshapes-critical-thinking/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Apr 2025 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2025/04/11/the-cognitive-impact-how-genai-reshapes-critical-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Building on the understanding of the &amp;ldquo;Ironies of GenAI,&amp;rdquo; recent research went deeper into the specific cognitive impacts of these powerful tools, particularly on &lt;strong&gt;critical thinking&lt;/strong&gt;. A 2025 study, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf"&gt;The Impact of Generative AI on Critical Thinking: Self-Reported Reductions in Cognitive Effort and Confidence Effects From a Survey of Knowledge Workers&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; provides crucial insights into this domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that while GenAI can enhance efficiency, it also introduces significant shifts in how knowledge workers engage in critical thinking. One key finding revolves around &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Confidence Effects&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;: higher confidence in GenAI&amp;rsquo;s ability to perform a task is associated with less critical thinking, even though users might perceive it as less effortful. Conversely, higher self-confidence in one&amp;rsquo;s own ability to do the task is linked to more critical thinking, often accompanied by a perception of greater effort. This suggests a risk of &lt;strong&gt;over-reliance&lt;/strong&gt; on AI, where users may accept outputs without sufficient critical evaluation, potentially leading to errors and a decline in independent problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unexpected WCF Service Failure: The Hidden Impact of Dormant Monitoring Tools</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2024/07/19/unexpected-wcf-service-failure-the-hidden-impact-of-dormant-monitoring-tools/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 10:52:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2024/07/19/unexpected-wcf-service-failure-the-hidden-impact-of-dormant-monitoring-tools/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, we encountered a perplexing issue with our WCF services that highlighted an important lesson about the long-term effects of unused software on our systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Problem:
Our WCF services suddenly stopped functioning correctly, returning the following error message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The exception message is 'A property with the name 'UriTemplateMatchResults' already exists.'. See server logs for more details.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This error occurred on all environments where Instana, a monitoring tool, had been installed, despite the fact that it had been switched off for several years.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Maximizing Developer Productivity: Beyond the Code</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2024/01/24/maximizing-developer-productivity-beyond-the-code/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2024 08:03:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2024/01/24/maximizing-developer-productivity-beyond-the-code/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the fast-paced tech industry, the key to maximizing developer productivity lies not just in the code they write but in the culture and communication that surrounds them. It’s a dynamic process that requires more than just technical prowess; it requires a shift in mindset and approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the development process has been viewed as a straightforward transaction: management dictates what to build, and developers execute. However, this method can lead to inefficiencies, misinterpretations, and a heavy burden on the managerial layer, already strained with decision-making responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Yerkes-Dodson's Law: Why Stress and Laziness are Equally Bad</title><link>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2023/03/13/yerkes-dodsons-law-why-stress-and-laziness-are-equally-bad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cbuctok.github.io/digitaliziran.si/2023/03/13/yerkes-dodsons-law-why-stress-and-laziness-are-equally-bad/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Do you find yourself either stressing out or being lazy all the time? Well, according to Yerkes-Dodson&amp;rsquo;s Law, both of these behaviors can have negative consequences on your productivity and overall well-being. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the science behind this law and explain why it&amp;rsquo;s important to find a balance between stress and laziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-stress-and-laziness-are-equally-bad-yerkes-dodsons-law-explained"&gt;Why Stress and Laziness are Equally Bad: Yerkes-Dodson&amp;rsquo;s Law Explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yerkes-Dodson&amp;rsquo;s Law is a psychological principle that explains the relationship between stress and performance. Essentially, the law states that there is an optimal level of stress that leads to peak performance, but too much or too little stress can actually hinder productivity. This means that both too much stress and too much relaxation can be detrimental to your success.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Zakaj stres ni vedno slaba stvar?

Kaj pa, če vam povemo, da stres ni vedno slaba stvar? V skladu z Yerkes-Dodsonovim zakonom je lahko malo stresa dejansko koristno. Preden se prestrašite zaradi prihajajočega roka ali predstavitve, preberite, zakaj je stres morda vendarle vaš prijatelj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ste-pod-stresom-ne-prestrašite-se-še"&gt;Ste pod stresom? Ne prestrašite se&amp;hellip; še!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vsi smo se že kdaj srečali s prepotenimi dlanmi, pospešenim bitjem srca in strahovitim občutkom strahu, ki se pojavijo ob stresu. Toda preden posežete po Xanaxu, upoštevajte naslednje: malo stresa lahko dejansko izboljša vašo učinkovitost. Res je, stres vas lahko motivira, saj vam pomaga, da se osredotočite in ostanete budni. Težava nastane šele, ko stres postane preobsežen in kroničen.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
